								You wanted the best and you got this! Play as Ribentina Tina, lvl 60 Cupid, who must match lovey-dovey Seals together. Read complex facial cues to determine who is lying. Maneuver the Shark to turn delinquent Seals into model citizens. Good Shark play is the foundation of this game and adds a level of depth never before seen in the match-making game genre. We hope you'll enjoy Super Gondola Ride whatever 64! (Legal Disclaimer: Shark not included.)<br>

								<div><h4>What accomplishments are you proud of in this game jam?</h4> I wanted to design something original and different from anything I've made or played before. I don't think this game is unique, but I've never played anything like it. I made up everything as I went along and I'm glad it turned out to be fun to make and, hopefully, fun to play! (I also got to meme a lot, lol.)</div>
								<br>I hope people enjoy all the dialog I wrote! The dialog-writing and stage design was by far the most time-consuming part for me -- but also really fun! ^^;;

							<h2>Event Explanation</h2>
							<p>We are hosting a <b>two day event,</b> the first VTuber Game Dev Potluck! This event will take place on <b>February 6, and February 13, in your own timezone</b>. This event is designed with <b>first time game creators</b> in mind. If you have never made a game, or if you're an experienced veteran, this event is for everyone! You do not need to be a vtuber to participate. You are not required to participate on both days, but I hope you will! My hope is that this format will allow people from all disciplines to participate and collaborate to create some fun games in a way that is not too stressful. The spacing of the days will allow people to work within their own timezones. This event was designed for solo work, but you can team up on either day if you want. There is no sign up required for this event.</p>
							<h3>Day One, 6 February</h3>
							<p>The theme for the event will be announced at 0:00 UTC +14 (AKA, when February 6th starts on planet earth) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LuaLuckyCh">on my channel</a>. On February 6th, everyone will make assets related to the theme. These assets can be <b>anything</b>. We want to have a HUGE VARIETY of things we can use and inspire us to make our games on day two. Here's a list of examples of types of assets you can create:
							<ul>
								<li>Sprites/Images/Drawings</li>
								<li>Animations</li>
								<li>Music</li>
								<li>Sound Effects</li>
								<li>3D Models</li>
								<li>Narrative Scripts/Plot Summaries</li>
								<li>Design Documents for Mechanics</li>
								<li>Code snippets</li>
								<li>etc.</li>
							</ul>
							This list is not exhaustive, but I hope it will get your ideas flowing. Please make as many assets as you feel comfortable making. Please understand that any assets you submit for this event will be available to the public under Creative Commons BY. Game makers will be permitted to remix and edit your assets. Asset deadline is February 10th. The deadline to submit your finished games is February 15th.</p>
							
							<h3>Day Two, 13 February</h3>
							<p>On this day everyone will create games using the shared pool of assets. You are NOT required to only use these assets, but I hope they will make up the main elements of your game. You are free to edit and remix the assets as you see fit for use in your game. At 0:00 UTC +14 (AKA, when February 13th starts on planet earth) the information on how to download everyone's assets will be right here.</p>
							<p><b>FOR INEXPERIENCED GAME DEVELOPERS:</b> A template project will be created for people who do not have experience coding. This template project will be made in an engine that uses visual coding, and it will already have all of the assets within it. My hope is that even people with no experience coding or making games will take this opportunity to practice and learn some new skills. The download link for that project will be at the top of the page at the start of Day 2.</p>
